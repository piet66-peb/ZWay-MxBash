# MxBash Linux Tools

This package contains a collection of useful Linux bash scripts for 
administration of Z-Way, such as start, stop, backup, update, cpu analysis, 
rotate logs, .... 
They can be conveniently started from a menu. The module does nothing but 
download the software.

## Prerequisites

Z-Way.

## Installation

- download the package from the Z-Way App Store
- make the bash scripts executable, if they aren't (sudo chmod a+x *.bash)
- rename the file **params_template** to **params** and enter your data
  (necessary for some functions)
- for convenient call of zway.bash without path add this to your **~/.profile**:
  + USERMODULES="/opt/z-way-server/automation/userModules"
  + PATH="$USERMODULES/MxBash/sh/:$PATH"

## Start the Menu

zway.bash

## Z-Way Start/Stop Management

This script can use the new start/ stop mechanism **Systemd**, availabe in
many current Linux distributions. To take 
advantage of the benefits, follow the installation instructions in the 
**z-way-server.service** file.

Please note: Don't delete the **SysVinit** configuration file **/etc/init.d/z-way-server**.
It is still used by Z-Way, for example during an upgrade.
